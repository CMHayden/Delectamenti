      <img src="steakandchips.png" alt="Steak and Chips" height="155px" width="220px" padding="15px" align = "left"></img>
      Ingredients: <br></br>
      2 large Maris Piper potatoes<br />
      1 x 220g / 8oz steak, cut from a whole piece<br />
      2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />
      Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
      handful of parsley leaves<br />
      Dijon mustard, to serve<br />
      50g of Pecorino cheese<br />
      salt and pepper to taste<br />
      <br />
      Directions:
      <ol>
        <li> For the chips, peel the potatoes and cut into whatever size you prefer. Wash well in
          cold water until the water runs clear, drain and pat dry with a clean tea
          towel.</li>
        <li> Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with
          vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 140C-160C/285F-300F (use a probe thermometer to check
          the temperature if you're not using a deep-fat fryer). (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous.
          Don't leave unattended)</li>
        <li> Carefully place the chips in the hot oil and cook for 7-8 minutes or until just cooked
          through (without colouring). Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon, drain onto kitchen
          paper and set aside to cool. You may do this a few hours in advance, keeping the chips
          covered, in the fridge.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, to finish the chips, deep-fry the chips in batches again in the oil at
          180C/350F for two minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper
          and season lightly with salt.</li>
        <li> For the steak, cut small slits across the line of fat on the steak and drizzle a
          little oil over the fat. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Salt the edge of the fat
          on the steak and place it onto the pan, standing it up on the fatty edge. Hold it there
          for a few seconds until the fat begins to run down the grooves of the grill; this is all
          the lubrication you will need to cook the steak</li>
        <li>Allow the steak to fall over, season it very lightly with salt and plenty of pepper,
          then grill for two minutes on each side for a rare steak; three minutes for medium;
          and four minutes for well-done. However, remember the thinner the steak, the less
          the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, leave the steak to rest on a warm plate in a warm place (such as a
          very low oven) for a few minutes, so that the juices will settle evenly within the
          meat, while also allowing the meat to relax and become even tenderer.</li>
        <li>Serve the steak and chips with Dijon mustard.</li>
      </ol>
